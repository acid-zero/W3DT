====

Warcraft 3D Toolkit (W3DT) is an open-source suite of powerful tools designed to provide assistance with exporting and converting models, terrain, textures, sounds and more from the game World of Warcraft by Blizzard Entertainment. It has been designed and built with machinima artists in mind however any 3D project looking to use assets from World of Warcraft may benefit from its use.

The development of this open source software is primarily driven by [Kruithne](https://twitter.com/Kruithne) and is supported by [FinalBossTV](http://finalboss.tv/).

**Key Features**

- Navigate maps via a minimap interface, select regions and export the full-terrain to external programs.
- Explore client databases that contain strings and other useful information about the game.
- Play sounds and music from the game in any of the available languages.

Contributing
============

Anyone is welcome to contribute to W3DT providing they follow a few basic rules!

- All changes must be tested on your own local copy before submitting a pull request. If the application does not build or does not function as intended, do not make the pull request until it's fixed.
- While no strict code-guidelines exist, please try to follow the same code-style used in the rest of the project. Majorly messy code will be rejected.
- If you're going to be working on one of the larger issues listed (which is greatly appreciated), please post a comment on said issue to signify that you are doing so to prevent other people wasting their time doing the same thing.
- Commits must be helpfully worded; just writing "Fix" will get your pull-request rejected.
- Pull-requests should be descriptive; explain fully what your change does so that questions don't have to be asked.
